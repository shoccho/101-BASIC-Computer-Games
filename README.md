# 101-BASIC-Computer-Games
An attempt to rewrite all the games in python  from the book " 101 BASIC Computer Games "

# WHY!?
I've been a huge fan of old electronics and computers although I don't own any retro tech currenty but I really enjoy playing older games on emulators. So after a lot of videos on Commodore C64, Vic 20 and many more 8bit computers and basic I wnated to try out basic. So I got a digital copy of the book 101 BASIC Computer Games which has 101 one games written in basic which you could write . I tried to run a few of them on the emulator but writing basic on a C64 emulator was a pain. So I'll try to rewrite those in python here . 

# How to run these

I've included the code for each game in python3 and also in BASIC . if you want to try out the games you can simply run them using python3 . If you want to use the BASIC version  well goodluck with that. As basic isn't that much standerdized it will be a huge hassle to run these. I have tried quite a few BASIC interpreters and Commodore 64 emulators .  I recommend using  pcbasic (v1.2) ( I've tested this using linux ) you can download pcbasic form here http://robhagemans.github.io/pcbasic/

as for the licensing of the BASIC codes I don't think there would be any problems as they were distributed in books and magazines. I have kept the credits of the original coders in the beginning of the codes. 

Also please note that the codes aren't optimized and  has not been written following standerds I just wanted to rewrite them in python . I tired to keep the original feel so every text exactly same in python version and BASIC version.

Thanks!
