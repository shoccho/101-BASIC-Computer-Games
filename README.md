# 101-BASIC-Computer-Games
An attempt to rewrite all the games in python  from the book " 101 BASIC Computer Games "

# WHY!?
I've been a huge fan of old electronics and computers although I don't own any retro tech currenty but I really enjoy playing older games on emulators. So after a lot of videos on Commodore C64, Vic 20 and many more 8bit computers and basic I wnated to try out basic. So I got a digital copy of the book 101 BASIC Computer Games which has 101 one games written in basic which you could write . I tried to run a few of them on the emulator but writing basic on a C64 emulator was a pain. So I'll try to rewrite those in python here .
